# Fingerprint ID Safe with Keypad
Safes need the best security to protect your valuables, and this safe will contain two different measures of safety: the fingerprint sensor and keypad. No one shares the same fingerprint pattern, so access to the safe is exclusive to you. The keypad will provide another layer of protection as only you will have memory of the code.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was enrolling my fingerprint onto the fingerprint module to make the servo motor rotate. I first had to correctly wire the fingerprint sensor to the Arduino board and then upload code from the Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library to the Arduino board to enroll my fingerprint onto the sensor. I enrolled my fingerprint by saving it as "ID 1" and then placing my finger on the fingerprint sensor while it lit up.
